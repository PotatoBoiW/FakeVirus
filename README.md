# FakeVirus
Create A Fake Virus
Create a notepad file, call whatever you like with .vbs as the extension (e.g: Computer.vbs)
Add this line of code --  X=MsgBox("Message Description",0+16,"Title")
Change "Message Description" to whatever you desire.
The 0 before the addition symbol (+) can be changed to:
0 = Ok Button
1 = Ok/Cancel Button
2 = Abort/Retry/Ignore
3 = Yes/No/Cancel
4 = Yes/No
5 = Retry/Cancel

The 16 after the addition symbol (+) can be changed to:
16 = Critical icon
32 = Help icon
48 = Warning icon
64 = Info icon

The "Title" can be changed to anything (make sure to leave the inverted commas).

Skip a line and paste (X=MsgBox("Message Description",0+16,"Title")) and change the sections above to make a fake virus (completely harmless)
